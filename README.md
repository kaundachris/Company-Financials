# Company-Financials
I needed a way to pull financial data on the go for any company that interests me.
This code pulls the data and writes it to an excel file, from where I can work with the data I need.
It currently takes a while to pull the data - there's a lag every time you run the function.
The data also gets pulled in a format not exactly right - not in the format of the financial statements
